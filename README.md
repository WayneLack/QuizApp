# QuizApp
 The purpose of this project is initially to develop a basic quiz app in python and gain some familiarity with TKinter and classes in 
python.

Below I outline the vague longer term plans, though the exact journey will depend on what I feel will help me develop useful coding 
skills at the time, so this may change. 
 - Phase 1 is to add way more questions so I can actually get quizin
 - Phase 2 is to neaten up the way it looks a bit more, features like changing the size of the window not messing it up, colour schemes, and general positioning of buttons
 - Phase 3 is to update the format so that if it ever goes live as an app, it will already look appish in structure. This will include separating the functions within my 
	python script into individual files e.g. main.py, buttons.py, etc. 
 - Phase 4 is a bigger phase, adding more and more features. I'm talking sounds, I'm talking game modes, I'm talking dark mode baby 
 - Phase 5 is to change the structure to be truly app like, so updatinng the languages where necessary and introducing new files of code to go from a complete python 
	script to an app
 - Phase 6 is the add app like features, since it will now be app-like. Things like a scoreboard, in-game achievements, adverts, and the ability to share on your facebook 
	so your nan can see
 - Phase 7 is of course to make millions on the app store
